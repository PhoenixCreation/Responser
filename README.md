# Responser

A handy tool to check responsiveness of your website.

## Why?

- All dev tools have this feature but it requires dev tool to be open for that.
- Running dev tool will decrease your website speed and performance.
- It is also not good for checking responsiveness of your website for higher resolution then your monitor.
- It also works for localhost websites so no need to worry, you can check responsiveness of your localhost website.

## Usage

- Enter url in the input box. and click `check the site` button.
- Your site will appear in the iframe.
- You can change width and height of the iframe.
- If you want to check for higher resolution then you can zoom out the original website and then check responsiveness.
- **for chromium based browser only i.e. chrome, edge** You can resize the iframe from bottom right corner.**This does not work in firefox.**

## Recommended browsers

- Chrome, why? Because you can resize by dragging the bottom right corner and it is widely used browser.
